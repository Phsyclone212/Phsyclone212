- 👋 Hi, I’m @Phsyclone212
- 👀 I’m interested in coding video games, building websites, really just doing everything we can with computers and technology.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about web development and OOP
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on smaller projects for things like video game plugins, mods, or desktop applications.
- 📫 How to reach me: Honestly? I'm not yet sure. Does Github have a dm feature?
